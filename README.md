# Development and calculation of the structural descriptors for nuclear receptors  
The project is aimed at exploring the possibility of using structural descriptors to distinguish patterns in protein binding methods, in particular nuclear receptors (NRs). The study is conducted on the example of Vitamin D Receptor (VDR), as a nuclear receptor with known structure and binding methods.  
### Project goal  
The aim is to create a library of structural descriptors and calculate them on the example of nuclear receptors.  
### Tasks of the project  
- To make a preliminary list of structural descriptors based on literature references and own suggestions;
- To form the final list of descriptors;
- To download protein structures of NRs from PDB;
- To create the calculation tools of structural descriptors for the PDB structures.
